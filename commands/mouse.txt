xinput list

#2#
#list properites of an input device

#i.e. xinput list-props "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint"
xinput list-props "<input device>"

#3#
#change the value of the properties of an input device

#i.e. xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "libinput Left Handed Enabled" 1
# will override the mouse buttons above touchpad
# useful, as kde in fedora does not handle the "mouse click emulation" correctly for left handed.  This
# still maps to right handed user, thus, 1 tap on the touchpad will emulate a right click.
# Changing the mouse setting to right handed, and running xinput set-prop command to enable left handed, fixes the
# emulation of tapping
xinput set-prop "<input device>" "<property>" <value>
